An eclectic blend of art, water and whimsy, the canal-lined island of Matlacha
makes the most of its 440 acres. It’s teeming with galleries, painted bright
Caribbean hues and selling handcrafted treasures like seashell flowers and
mermaid sculptures. Backyards open onto waterfront gardens where bottle trees
flourish alongside polka dot buoys and boaters pull up for a chat to while away
the afternoon. It's even fun to say — “matt-la-shay” — though no one knows
exactly where the name came from.

What we do know is the island, dredged up from oyster beds in the 1920s, was
once a thriving fishing village. When the industry died, the community got
creative, literally, transforming its main street into a tropical, technicolor
canvas of shops and seafood shacks.

The surrounding tidal flats, meanwhile, owe nothing to art. They're scenic and
alive, popular for birdwatching, crabbing, shrimping and fishing or simply
admiring a glorious Gulf Coast sunset.

Leoma Lovegrove, a Matlacha artist who owns a gallery on the island, sums it up
best: “When I cross over the Matlacha Island bridge, I fall in love with my
little fishing village all over again. It’s home, the place that always inspires
me to pick up my paintbrush.”

Here are the Matlacha experiences you can’t miss.

## Soak in Galleries Galore

Effusive and fanciful, Matlacha’s art covers everything from blown glass to
coconut postcards. Browse work by dozens of local artists at [Matlacha
Menagerie](https://www.facebook.com/matlachamenagerie/) and Island Visions, just
steps from each other. Funkiest of all, [Leoma Lovegrove’s
gallery](www.leomalovegrove.com) includes a one-of-a-kind garden, featuring a
Beatles stage, a 1960s glamper and several palm trees, all painted with her
signature bold strokes.

Designed as the fudge shop of your childhood memories, [CW Fudge
Factory](https://cwfudge.info/) is stocked with nostalgic candy, homemade
popcorn, truffles and more. But most importantly, there’s fudge: around 30
flavors on any given day that might include salted caramel, sangria, coconut
cream pie, pistachio or creme brulee. You can even watch it being made on-site.

## See Dolphins on an Eco Tour

The protected estuary surrounding Matlacha is a haven for eagles, ospreys,
dolphins, even manatees who winter in the warmer waters. Get a glimpse of these
and more on one of [Captain Cathy’s Eagle boat tours](https://www.captaincathy.com/)
through the protected estuary. She'll also tell you all about the Calusa tribe
and their magnificent shell mounds, which you can still see today.

Sporting names like Flamingo and Margarita and vivid exteriors that range from
turquoise to tangerine, the houses at [Matlacha Tiny
Village](https://www.matlachatinyvillage.com/) perfectly match the rest of the
town. Overnight guests have all they need with a kitchenette, outdoor grill,
picnic table, dock and kayak launch.

## Paddle the Preserve

Chart your own course through the Matlacha Pass Aquatic Preserve. It’s less than
six feet at its deepest and welcoming for first-timers and families. You can
rent a kayak or paddle board from [Gulf Coast
Kayak](https://www.gulfcoastkayak.com/), but if you want to venture into the
maze of mangroves, go with one of their guides.
