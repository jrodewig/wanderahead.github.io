From the misty peaks of the Blue Ridge to the breezy shores of the Lowcountry,
South Carolina blends Southern charm with natural beauty. Stroll beneath the
moss-draped oaks of Charleston, unwind on the sandy stretches of Hilton Head, or
hike the waterfalls of the Upstate â€” the Palmetto State invites you to slow down
and savor it all.
