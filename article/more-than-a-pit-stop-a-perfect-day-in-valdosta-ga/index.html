      <article class="article"><p>Less than 20 minutes north of the Florida border, Valdosta holds the dubious
honor of being the last stop in Georgia for sunshine-hungry travelers heading
south for summer vacation. The city has long since grown used to the throngs of
tourists, though, expanding its lineup of attractions, shopping and restaurants
to meet the demand for entertainment. And that means it should be much more than
a stop-off on your drive. Take a day to explore some of what this southern town
has to offer.</p>

<h2 id="spend-the-morning-at-wild-adventures">Spend the Morning at Wild Adventures</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/wild-adventures-valdosta-ga-665.webp" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/wild-adventures-valdosta-ga-320.webp 320w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/wild-adventures-valdosta-ga-480.webp 480w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/wild-adventures-valdosta-ga-665.webp 665w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="Wild Adventures in Valdosta, GA" width="665" height="442" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>Start off at <a href="https://www.wildadventures.com/">Wild Adventures</a>, a theme park
that combines roller coasters, animals and a water park into one.</p>

<p>It’s far and away Valdosta’s most popular attraction and plenty busy during
summer weekends. Get there when they open to beat the crowds and enjoy shorter
wait times. Animal exhibits are scattered throughout the park: lions, capybara,
monkeys.</p>

<h2 id="eat-empanadas-in-the-afternoon">Eat Empanadas in the Afternoon</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/empanadas-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-665.webp" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/empanadas-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-320.webp 320w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/empanadas-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-480.webp 480w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/empanadas-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-665.webp 665w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="Empanadas at Empanadas &amp; More restaurant in Valdosta, GA" width="665" height="442" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>Depending on your group, you may want to play longer at Wild Adventures, but if
you just have one day in the city, head out in the afternoon to see the rest of
Valdosta.</p>

<p>For a late lunch, try <a href="http://www.empanadasandmorevaldosta.com/">Empanadas &amp;
More</a>. The Latin fusion restaurant
opened in 2013 and serves arepas, chorizo, yuca, plantains and a host of South
American favorites at a brightly colored cafe in an otherwise unassuming strip
mall. Of course, their specialty is the empanada, stuffed with chicken, cheese,
beef or any combination of the above. The food tastes incredibly fresh, worth
savoring the layers of spices and contrasting textures.</p>

<p>It’s all good, but their crisp empanadas are the stars. Order at least two.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/steak-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-665.webp" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/steak-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-320.webp 320w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/steak-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-480.webp 480w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/steak-at-empanadas-and-more-in-valdosta-ga-665.webp 665w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="Steak at Empanadas &amp; More restaurant in Valdosta, GA" width="665" height="442" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>“Normally, in our culture, empanadas are a snack. Here, it’s an entree,” said
owner Alberto Sanchez. “We are not fancy people, but we make sure that what you
get at the table is the best.”</p>

<p>The affordable and filling lunch combos bring in mostly locals and the
occasional out-of-towner lucky enough to find this hidden gem.</p>

<p>After your meal, stroll the romantic grounds of “<a href="https://www.thecrescentvaldosta.com/">The
Crescent</a>,” a neoclassical home built in
1898, now on the National Register of Historic Places. The building gets its
name from the curved front porch punctuated with 13 columns, one for each of the
original colonies, and it’s the most notable landmark in the city. Anyone can
visit, free of charge, for a self-guided tour of the interior, with period
furniture, between 2 and 5 p.m. weekdays.</p>

<p>To round out your afternoon, head downtown. Valdosta’s Central Avenue strip is
pleasantly walkable and filled with boutiques and emporiums perfect for casual
window shopping or serious bargain hunting. While you’re there, stop into the
<a href="http://turnercenter.org/">Annette Howell Turner Center for the Arts</a>. Exhibits
include everything from African masks, musical instruments and totems to
European antiques and fine porcelain.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/epic-escape-rooms-valdosta-ga-665.webp" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/epic-escape-rooms-valdosta-ga-320.webp 320w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/epic-escape-rooms-valdosta-ga-480.webp 480w,           /assets/img/2025-04-12-more-than-a-pit-stop-a-perfect-day-in-valdosta-ga/epic-escape-rooms-valdosta-ga-665.webp 665w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="Epic Escape Rooms in Valdosta, GA" width="665" height="442" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>The day isn’t over yet. Keep the energy going at <a href="https://www.epicescapega.com/">Epic Escape
Rooms</a>. The family-run venue offers six
themed adventures where you and your group can try to escape from a locked room
with puzzles that will guide you to freedom. Ask for clues if you need extra
help, but look sharp; there’s more then one twist in the game. For a highly
unusual room, take on The Mad Hatter. You’ll have to outsmart the a trickster
villain who won’t let you leave Wonderland.</p>

<p>Whether you make it out in an hour or come close, you’ll be surprised how much
fun you have trying — so much so that you’ll be probably still be talking about
your adventure, and the rest of your Valdosta day, as head to your next
destination, wherever that may be.</p>
