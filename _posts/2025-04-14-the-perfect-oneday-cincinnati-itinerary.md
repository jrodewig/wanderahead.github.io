delivers a perfect blend of classic and offbeat. Here's how to make the most of
one unforgettable day in Cincinnati.


## Visiting the Cincinnati Zoo

A must-see is the [Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical
Garden](http://cincinnatizoo.org/), America's second oldest zoo which opened in 1875.
The zoo is carefully designed so that even with crowds, there's a natural
flow as you move through the park.

Be sure to check out the lions, who often sun themselves in the morning.

The primates are also a must-see, especially if you enjoy slapstick antics in
African jungle Gorilla World.

## Lunch in Cincinnati

After the zoo, you'll be hungry. Fortunately, Cincinnati is a true foodie city. 

All over town, you can find [Graeter's](https://www.graeters.com/), a Cincinnati
institution. You can't go wrong with a scoop of their black raspberry chocolate
chip, which  accounts for a quarter of their sales.

I also recommend trying Cincinnati chili, made with Mediterranean spices and
noodles. [Skyline Chili](https://skylinechili.com/) is a popular local chain.
You may have seen cans of their product in your local grocery store.

If you're craving something more familiar, [4th & Walnut Restaurant &
Tavern](https://4th-walnut.com/) serves a killer burger of Angus beef topped
with braised shortrib. 

If you're not sure what you want and variety sounds nice, stop in at the
year-round [Findlay Market](https://www.findlaymarket.org/).

## The Unusual Mushroom House in Hyde Park

Cincinnati is home to some world-class museums and attractions. One hidden gem
that's both Instagrammable and unusual is the Mushroom House in the Hyde Park
neighborhood.

This whimsical, organic structure, designed by architect Terry Brown, looks like
it sprouted from a fairy tale with its wavy lines, colorful mosaics, and
fungus-like walls. It's a quirky stop that perfectly captures Cincy's knack for
blending art with the unexpected.

## Flowers, Art, and an Arch at Eden Park

While you're in town, spend an hour strolling the 186-acre [Eden
Park](https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/cincyparks/) with sculptures, fountains,
flowers and scenic views of the Ohio River valley. 

If you have extra time, visit the [Cincinnati Art
Museum](https://www.cincinnatiartmuseum.org/), located inside the park.
Admission is free. You can also admire the outdoor installation art, including
the Art Climb staircase.

If the weather isn't flower-friendly, as sometimes happens in Ohio, the [Krohn
Conservatory](https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/cincyparks/visit-a-park/find-a-parkfacility/krohn-conservatory/)
is blooming year-round. There's a small admission fee, but it's a lush green
escape in winter worth the cost.

Near the entrance of the park is a favorite local sight: a Romanesque castle
arch called Elsinore Tower. It's not a garden folly (as much as I love those).
It's actually an 1880s water tower inspired by a production of *Hamlet*. The
theatrical arch is a fitting architectural flourish for the park, which is also
home to your last stop of the night: the [Cincinnati
Playhouse](https://cincyplay.com/).


## Live Theater at Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park

A professional regional theater company founded in 1959, [the Cincinnati
Playhouse in the Park](http://www.cincyplay.com/) puts on nearly a dozen shows
each season for sold-out audiences. 

On show nights, the playhouse is a bustling entertainment complex. If you
haven't had dinner yet, you can grab something to eat here 90 minutes before the
show at the [Delish Dish](https://cincyplay.com/visit/eat-drink) or have a drink
at one of the two full-service bars. 

The lobby also features a 95-foot mural crowded with caricatures of playwrights
and actors connected to the playhouse. On display, you can admire their
prestigious Regional Theatre Tony Awards. They're really that good.
