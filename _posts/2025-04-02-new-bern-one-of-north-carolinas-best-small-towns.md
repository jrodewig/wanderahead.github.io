One of the oldest cities in North Carolina and the state's first capital, New
Bern is an ideal destination for anyone seeking a blend of history, nature, and
great food in a unique setting. It's conveniently located just two hours from
Raleigh and the coastal town of Wilmington, making it an easy stop on any road
trip through the region.

New Bern boasts some standout claims to fame: the 1890s drugstore where Pepsi
was born, over 80 life-size bear sculptures scattered throughout the city, and
the awe-inspiring Tryon Palace, a sprawling testament to grandeur.

Whether you stick to the walkable waterfront downtown or venture out to explore
the waterways and the 157,000-acre Croatan National Forest, there's plenty to
see and do. This article won't cover it all, but here are the essential
experiences to prioritize when you visit New Bern.

## Get Out on the Water

You can't visit New Bern without getting out on the water. Positioned at the
meeting point of two rivers, the city is defined by its aquatic surroundings.
Paddleboarding, kayaking, boating, fishing — the options are endless, but a guided
cruise stands out as an accessible and engaging way to take it all in. It's
straightforward and informative: just show up, and let the captain handle the
rest.

Book a two-hour cruise with [Anchors Up Marine
Solutions](https://www.anchorsupms.com/) to navigate the mighty Neuse River, the
quieter Trent River, and even Brices Creek. On one tour, Capt. Matthew Gotz, a
USCG Master, shared a wealth of insights, explaining the "Neuse River mustache,"
pointing out turtles and wildlife, showcasing multimillion-dollar waterfront
properties, and recounting the tale of America's first registered nurse and her
obscure link to "Brad's Drink."

The 22-foot covered boat seats up to six and can be enclosed if the weather
turns chilly. Morning, afternoon, and sunset tours run daily — opt for the sunset
slot for breathtaking wetland views or the morning for serene calm. Bring snacks
to enjoy onboard.

Your local captain knows New Bern inside and out, so feel free to ask questions.
Booking the whole boat lets you customize the experience. Focus on history,
wildlife, boats, or simply relax with music and conversation.

**Pro tip:** Use the onboard binoculars for birdwatching. Blue jays, ospreys, belted
kingfishers, and cardinals are common sights. Or just to zoom in on the scenery.

## Go Out on the Town

Here's a key fact about New Bern: bears. Not the living kind, but the symbolic
ones. Named after Bern, Switzerland, where the bear is a heraldic icon, New Bern
embraces this connection with over 80 fiberglass bear sculptures around town.
Tracking them down is a fun challenge; grab a map from the visitors center if
you want a head start.

Spot a bear in a green vest, and you've found Mitchell Hardware. Step inside
this 1898 general store for a dose of nostalgia. It's stocked with everything
from birdhouses to barbecue sauce to boating gear and doubles as an attraction
itself.

Nearby, The Birthplace of Pepsi marks the spot where a local pharmacist
concocted the drink in 1898. Check out vintage artifacts like Pepsi lunch boxes,
international bottles, even a Mountain Dew hillbilly mural. Then grab a Pepsi
float and popcorn at the soda shop.

For a livelier outing, hit Beary The Hatchet, an axe-throwing spot that's equal
parts quirky and thrilling. Axes, ninja stars, knives, even shovels. You can try
them all, and the axe coach will guide you through the technique (it's less
about strength, more about finesse).

Reservations are smart, especially on weekends, but walk-ins are welcome. Snacks
and drinks are available, and they've got close-toed shoes to rent if you need
them.

**Tip:** Swing by on "Broke Axe Mondays" for 40% off an hour of throwing.

## Stop in at the Palace

  alt="Tyron Palace in New Bern, NC"
  width="665"
  height="499"
  loading="lazy"
/>

If a road trip can include a palace, you don't skip it. Tryon Palace, with its
16 acres of gardens, is a showstopper worth the detour.

This three-in-one attraction features historic buildings, meticulously designed
gardens, and the 60,000-square-foot North Carolina History Center. Wander at
your leisure, though the palace itself requires a timed guided tour. Your
period-dressed guide will explain how the original 1770 structure, built for the
royal colonial governor, burned down in 1798. Today's version is a faithful
recreation based on historical records.

Gov. William Tryon's lavish "palace," funded by steep taxes, didn't win him many
fans back then, and its opulence still impresses. Tour the replica ballroom
where George Washington danced or the surprisingly modern kitchen, where
18th-century cooking demos still happen.

**Don't miss:**

- The guided Dixon House tour, showcasing an early 1830s merchant's home
- The stables, the last remnant of the original palace
- The palace gardens, with
  clipped hedges, statues, and scenic pathways
- Backyard gardens at historic homes like the Stanly House, featuring heirloom camellias and a fountain with water
  lilies

Plan for at least three hours, or two, if you move quickly through the gardens
and museum.

## Where To Eat in New Bern

Downtown New Bern's dining scene is solid across the board, but here are
standout picks for every meal, plus a snack stop.

### Breakfast

  width="665"
  height="465"
  loading="lazy"
/>

[Baker's Kitchen Restaurant & Bakery](https://bakerskitchennb.com/) draws
crowds, especially on weekends during brunch hours. Known for fresh cinnamon
rolls and their famous Butter Syrup (shipped nationwide), they nail the
classics: eggs any way you like, plus Southern staples like country fried steak
and biscuits with gravy. Order à la carte to customize your plate; the "Twigs &
Berries" yogurt with granola is a lighter gem.

Service is quick and friendly, and the bright, welcoming vibe sets you up for
the day.

**Tip:** Save space for the pastry case. Muffins, cookies, and more await.

### Lunch

If you're at Tryon Palace, [Lawson's On The
Creek](https://www.lawsonsonthecreek.com/) at the North Carolina History Center
is a convenient waterfront option. Soups, salads, and sandwiches dominate the
menu, alongside craft beer, wine, and desserts. Expect crowd-pleasers like
grilled cheese and hot dogs, plus elevated picks like Reubens or shrimp salad.
The patio views are a bonus. It's worth stepping out for even if you eat inside.

### Dinner

  alt="Burger and mac-and-cheese at Morgan's Tavern & Grill in New Bern, NC"
  width="665"
  height="499"
  loading="lazy"
/>

[Morgan's Tavern & Grill](http://morganstavernnewbern.com/) might steal the show
with its steakburgers, a juicy blend of chuck roast, short rib, and brisket,
paired perfectly with creamy mac and cheese. Complimentary honey-drizzled
croissants kick things off right, and the menu spans salads, seafood, pasta,
ribs, and more, all with a local, seasonal twist.

Sit on the patio (with heaters or fans as needed) or inside the 1911
brick-walled space, adorned with art and lanterns. Snap a pic with the bear
statue for a shot at free food. Ask your server for details.

Dessert is a must, even if just to admire the platter.

### Coffee and Snack

[Bella's Cafe & Catering](https://www.bellascafenb.com/) has drinks for every
taste — smoothies, cappuccinos, Italian sodas — plus breakfast and lunch options
like a solid gyro. The baked goods look tempting, prices are fair, and the
atmosphere is pure relaxation: Wi-Fi, warm woodsy decor, comfy seats, and a
mellow playlist. It's a spot to linger.
