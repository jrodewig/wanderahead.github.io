excerpt: From experiental theatre to climbable sculpture, NYC has unique immersive art you can't find anywhere else.

NYC is known for its lively and vibrant art scene. Stunning work fills museums,
galleries, and stages throughout the city. But NYC is also home to the type of
immersive, experiential art you're not going to find anywhere else. For
something unforgettable, explore these eight experiences.

## 1. Life and Trust

A lot of experiences claim to be unique and immersive. I've tried dozens. None
come close to Life and Trust.

Life and Trust is a theatrical experience. But if you're thinking of
uncomfortable seats and sleepy audiences, think again. This immersive play
unfolds across six floors of a retrofitted skyscraper, Conwell Tower,
transformed into a multi-level Gilded Age set.

Using dance and acrobatic choreography, the performers tell the Faustian tale of
J.G. Conwell, chairman of the Life and Trust bank, who trades his soul to relive
his youth the night before the 1929 stock market crash.

          /assets/img/2025-04-15-immersive-art-experiences-in-nyc-that-will-dazzle-you/acrobatic-bank-vault-choreography-life-and-trust-480.webp 480w,

  sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px"
  alt="Acrobatic choreograph in the Conwell building's bank vault for Life and
  Trust in NYC"
  width="665"
  height="443"
  loading="lazy"
/>

But the story isn't all about Conwell. The narrative is non-linear and sprawls
across a cast of nearly 30 characters, including swindlers, mad scientists, and
a magician-like Mephistopheles. You'll see street fights, vaudeville acts, eerie
laboratories, boudoir romance, and even a sprawling indoor garden. And you're
not just watching. Audience members, masked and silent, roam freely, choosing
which storylines and characters to chase. You may even be invited to
participate.

Just come prepared: The show runs for three hours, and there are lots of stairs.
The story is also haunting and dark, so it may not be for everyone. You won't
see it all in one go, but don't worry — it's built for repeat visits. Trust me,
you'll want to come back.

## 2. Mercer Labs, Museum of Art and Technology

New York is known for its many museums. But until it opened in 2024, NYC had
nothing like [Mercer Labs](https://mercerlabs.com/). It's a collection of unique
art installations that combine art and technology using digital projections,
sound, light, mirrors, and other elements.

As the name suggests, the vibe at Mercer Labs is experimental. No room is like
another. Every corner you turn, every door you open is different. In one room,
everyone is sprawled on the floor. In another room, you spin on an adult-sized
swing as a giant dove, brought to life in 16K projection, flies toward you,
trailing digital gold dust in its wake.

  alt="The Dragon at Mercer Labs, Museum of Art and Technology in NYC"
  width="665"
  height="499"
  loading="lazy"
/>

*The Dragon* is my favorite. I've done infinity rooms before, but this one's on
another level. It's huge, for starters, and uses some mind-bending tech to float
voxels (yep, 3D pixels — I had to Google it too) in midair, like stepping into a
hologram.

  alt="Abstract chess set at Mercer Labs, Museum of Art and Technology in NYC"

  loading="lazy"
/>

Other exhibits are kinetic and hands-on. Guests can draw their names in shifting
lights. Or create a character that comes to life before them on screen. Or build
sandcastles with magnetic sand. Every experience is different. 

## 3. Vessel

<img
  src="/assets/img/2025-04-15-immersive-art-experiences-in-nyc-that-will-dazzle-you/vessel-view-in-nyc-665.webp"
  srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-15-immersive-art-experiences-in-nyc-that-will-dazzle-you/vessel-view-in-nyc-320.webp 320w,
          /assets/img/2025-04-15-immersive-art-experiences-in-nyc-that-will-dazzle-you/vessel-view-in-nyc-480.webp 480w,
          /assets/img/2025-04-15-immersive-art-experiences-in-nyc-that-will-dazzle-you/vessel-view-in-nyc-665.webp 665w"
  sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px"
  alt="Vessel view in NYC"
  width="665"
  height="499"
  loading="lazy"
/>

"Interactive" can mean different things to different people. It can mean
anything from pressing a button to immersive performance to just being able to
touch the art. It's rare for "interactive" to mean climbing *inside* the art,
but that's exactly what you'll do at Vessel."

A 150-foot sculpture outside Manhattan's Hudson Yards, Vessel is climbable art,
consisting of 154 flights of interlocking stairs. With 500 steps and 80 landings
to climb to, Vessel offers different views of the city as you scale it. Your
perspective is always changing, and even the facade, with its bronze-colored
reflective surface, shifts throughout the day.

<img
  src="/assets/img/2025-04-15-immersive-art-experiences-in-nyc-that-will-dazzle-you/vessel-near-hudson-yards-in-nyc-665.webp"

          /assets/img/2025-04-15-immersive-art-experiences-in-nyc-that-will-dazzle-you/vessel-near-hudson-yards-in-nyc-480.webp 480w,

  sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px"
  alt="Vessel near Hudson Yards in NYC"
  width="665"
  height="488"
  loading="lazy"
/>

While you can expect a workout, don't come to Vessel expecting a standard
observation deck. It's not high enough to give you a bird's-eye view of New
York. For that, head inside Hudson Yards for the Edge skydeck. Instead, Vessel
gives you a glimpse of the city from within the city. The sculpture itself can
serve as a frame for your photos.

## 4. Little Island

Every city has a playground. But only New York has Little Island.

Floating outside Pier 55 in the Hudson River, this 2.5-acre gem rests on funky,
funnel-shaped white columns. It's free, open to all ages, and steps from spots
like the High Line and Chelsea Market, so it slides right into your NYC
adventure.

  alt="A nighttime show at Little Island in NYC"
  width="665"
  height="443"
  loading="lazy"
/>

Whimsy's the name of the game here: think lush gardens, scampering wildlife, and
playful vibes that spark imagination. Depending on the season, you might grab a
hula hoop, spin dizzying optical illusion discs, twirl in a chair, or bang out
tunes on interactive instruments. Those boulders that cry out to be climbed?
It's allowed, and kids love them.

Winding trails and hilly paths turn the island into a secret wonderland, begging
to be explored. Families will love The Glade, a 200-seat venue dishing out free
shows, often crafted with kids in mind. Check the schedule online to catch
what's going on during your visit.

## 5. Museum of Ice Cream

<img

  alt="Dessert room at the Museum of Ice Cream in NYC"

Despite the Museum moniker, you won't find stuffy galleries at New York's Museum
of Ice Cream. How does "Unlimited ice cream" sound? Or "NYC's tallest indoor
slide?" If that doesn't grab you, maybe diving into a sprinkle-filled pool or
slurping stretchy booza ice cream will seal the deal.

The Museum of Ice Cream isn't just another museum in a city stacked with them.
It's three floors of pure, unfiltered fun, with 12 interactive stations all
featuring America's sweetest obsession. You'll dig into ice cream's surprisingly
wild history or discover how it's eaten worldwide, all while snapping
Instagrammable pics.

  alt="Banana room at the Museum of Ice Cream in NYC"

/>

Between the art, facts, and photo ops, you're handed sample
after sample. To prevent waste, the samples are perfectly portioned, but here's
the kicker: you can hit up seconds, thirds, or *as much as you want* before
bouncing to the next room.

They also weave in fun activities to keep your sugar rush in check. Families?
This place is gold. The staff's hyped-up energy pulls everyone in, and kids lose
it over a world built with ice cream. Grown-ups will have a blast too.

## 6. RiseNY

  alt="Beatles and Ed Sullivan Show display at RiseNY in NYC"

/>

Located in the lights and bustle of Times Square, RiseNY is an attraction
designed like a love letter to New York. Opened in March 2022, it's the city
distilled into one wild ride. No time for the Statue of Liberty or Broadway?
You'll get a juicy taste of the whole Big Apple here.

It kicks off with a film narrated by Jeff Goldblum, who spins the tale of NYC's
electric history with Times Square as its beating heart. Next, you hop on a
virtual subway to a museum inside the attraction, bursting with exhibits that
spotlight the city's icons and unsung heroes.

  alt="Wicked Broadway exhibit at RiseNY in NYC"
  width="665"
  height="499"
  loading="lazy"
/>

Snap a selfie with Oscar the Grouch or Bruce Springsteen's guitar. Geek out over
real-deal artifacts from NYC's starry past, plus photo ops like stepping into
the black-and-white kitchen from The Honeymooners. Or take in costumes from some
of Broadway's biggest shows, such as Hamilton and The Phantom of the Opera.

But the finale, a flight ride through New York, is the real knockout. You strap
into a theme-park-worthy ride that sends you soaring over NYC's skyline, with 8k
aerial footage so crisp it feels alive. Hoisted 30 feet up, you'll twist, dip,
and feel wind, mist, and scents that trick you into believing you're actually
flying. Short of chartering a private chopper, RiseNY is one of the best ways to
see New York from the sky.

## 7. Artechouse NYC

/>

Billed as the "Home for Innovation and Experiential Art," Artechouse — and
immersive digital art in general — is having a moment right now. Set in a
100-year-old boiler room below Chelsea Market, the main exhibit hall typically
features large-scale, wall-to-wall projects with accompanying music and sound
effects. Viewers can enjoy the show from cushions and bean bag chairs near the
room's large concrete columns.

The exhibitions rotate, featuring everything from moving art depicting outer
space to MTV-inspired concert footage to 8-bit avatars playing in a 3D world.
Check the [Artechouse website](https://www.artechouse.com/) to see times and
what's playing now.

Besides the main show, you can learn about past exhibits through a touch-screen
exhibit, play virtual instruments, or grab a drink at the bar. Each timed entry
is good for one hour, but that's plenty of time to see everything. They're open
every day, so it's easy to fit into your NYC visit.

## Where To Eat in NYC

In NYC, food is an art. And what could be more immersive than lighting up your
taste buds with a dozen different flavors? If you're craving unique tastes and
experiences, check out these NYC food halls for a choose-your-own culinary
adventure.

### Mercado Little Spain

Want to take a step outside New York? Mercado Little Spain is a slice of Iberia
right in the city. Created by Chef José Andrés, the market is three restaurants
and a sprawl of kiosks dishing up Spain's best bites all day long.

La Barra, one of its full-service spots, teleports you to Barcelona. There's a
dish to please everyone. The Jamón Ibérico de Bellota — you know, the giant ham
legs Spain is known for? — is cured for 48 months. Each slice is nutty, sweet,
and hands-down the best ham you'll ever taste. Kids and adults will like the
croquetas, crispy fritters stuffed with béchamel. Andrés and his brothers used
to steal tastes of the creamy filling as kids.

### Market 57

Just a short walk from Little Island, Market 57 is an international foodie hall
on Pier 57's ground floor in Chelsea. Opened in 2023 with the James Beard
Foundation's culinary cred, the market's various stalls dish up everything from
Indian dosas and Thai curries, to Mexican tacos and Caribbean wings. Coffee,
craft beer, boba tea? You can get it at Market 57.

If you want to enjoy your food with a view, take your meal up to Pier 57's
rooftop. It's a two-acre park with Hudson River views that'll make your visit
memorable.

If you want a casual vibe and tasty food, Moynihan Food Hall delivers. With 22
vendors, it's a feast: ramen, sushi, Southern comfort, burgers, bakeries, and
craft brews. A chic central bar keeps things lively, and there's tons of
seating, even when it's buzzing at weekend lunch.

If you want a classic NYC slice, stop by Sauce Pizzeria. I opted for a vodka
slice with a crisp, thin crust and sauce that slaps. If you want lighter fare,
Chopt has fresh salads on offer. My personal favorite is NAYA. Their Lebanese
bowl — packed with spiced meat, veggies, and sauces — was so generous it felt
like a steal. Dessert? Cha Cha Matcha's peanut butter-cold brew smoothie with
cacao and dates. Months later, my husband and I still talk about it.
