You’ve got your typical coffee joints and bakeries — and then there’s Amélie’s
French Bakery.

And you’ll want to linger.

At its core, Amélie’s is a fabulous French pastry shop with eclairs and bonbons
to tantalize your taste buds. They offer a range of drinks and savory eats to
round out your meal with fast and friendly service.

What started with a flagship cafe in Charlotte, North Carolina, has grown into a
beloved boutique chain with a satellite locations spreading the pastry love
across North and South Carolina.

And their food isn’t just good; it’s art. The cakes are things of beauty.
Splurge on a slice — or two. The pretty multicolored macarons are also a must,
sweet and utter bliss when paired with a fresh coffee.

Each cup of joe is made with North Carolina’s own Magnolia Coffee Company
roasted coffee. If you’re having trouble deciding, opt for a café crème, which
tempers rich espresso with steamed milk. Or if you’re feeling super fancy,
choose the café marcotter, an Amélie’s signature drink with vanilla bean syrup,
caramel, sea salt and probably magic.

The baguette and croissant sandwiches are hefty — half’s usually enough. Then
there’s the tartines, like French pizza but on buttered toast, topped with smart
pairings like Gruyère and duxelles. Dunk it in soup, and it’s next-level.

Now, the vibe. Picture bright hues, quirky salvaged art, and a playful French
flair — it’s Instagram gold. (The same designer decks out all their spots.) The
decor screams fun, bold, and a little offbeat.

Board games sit ready on a shelf if you can rope your crew into a round of
Cranium. Or bring your laptop and grind away on whatever’s on your plate. Plenty
of folks do.

Price-wise, it’s wallet-friendly for a cafe. Lunch runs about $10, pastries even
cheaper.

But good luck picking just one pastry — it’s a tall order, and frankly, I’d say
don’t bother trying. These treats are divine. Grab a buddy, sample a few, or box
some up for later. That’s the French way, isn’t it?
