      <article class="article"><p>Better known as a summertime retreat, Door County’s double-sided shoreline draws
sunbathers and surfers June through August when the weather peaks into a
pleasant mid-70s. It’s sometimes called the Cape Cod of the Midwest, with the
beaches, lighthouses, and seafood shacks to prove it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/snow-covered-wood-and-river-door-county-wi-665.webp" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/snow-covered-wood-and-river-door-county-wi-320.webp           320w,           /assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/snow-covered-wood-and-river-door-county-wi-480.webp   480w,   /assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/snow-covered-wood-and-river-door-county-wi-665.webp   665w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="Snow-covered wood and river   at Whitefish Dunes State Park in Door County, WI" width="665" height="499" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>In December, this Midwest beach town becomes an idyllic winter retreat.
Instead of shores and sand, you’ll find snowy landscapes, comfort food, and
festive holiday events.  This guide tells you the best hikes, eats, and
holiday treats to enjoy during your winter visit.</p>

<p>Every introduction to Door County’s scenic off-season should begin at Whitefish
Dunes State Park. The beachfront park turns snowy November through March when
you can trade in your swimsuit for snowshoes — though if visit in early
December, it’s not quite deep enough yet for snowshoes. Inside the park, you’re
surrounded by the postcard panoramas: towering hardwoods like oak, beech, and
maple intermixed with evergreens, all comfortably blanketed in white.</p>

<p>Begin your trek on the Yellow Trail, branching off to head down to the creek. It
might be slow going, not because of the terrain, which is fairly flat, but
because you’ll want to stop every few minutes to snap another photo. For those
who like to move faster, there are three cross-country skiing trails, the
longest over four miles. Ice fishing, another favorite winter pastime, is
possible at Clark Lake. The park even has a program to loan out fishing poles
and tackle, free of charge.</p>

<p>After finishing up the loop, head north to an outdoor escape of a different
kind. Björklunden — meaning “Birch Grove” in Swedish — is the northern campus of
Lawrence University, a venue for educational seminars. The tranquil setting
seems well-suited to contemplation. And if the landscape isn’t as dramatic as
Whitefish Dunes, Björklunden has something the state park doesn’t: a replica
12th-century Norwegian stavkirke.</p>

<p>Following a short trail from the lodge, you’ll arrive at a small clearing to
find Boynton Chapel, looking every bit the fairy tale with its dark exterior and
woodland backdrop. Blue-toned stained glass glimmers in the windows. The
scalloped eaves end in dragon heads, there to ward off evil. It’s one of two
stavkirkes in the county. The second, on Washington Island in the far north, is
another reproduction, built to honor the area’s early Scandinavian immigrants.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/frozen-shallows-harbor-door-county-wi-665.webp" srcset="/assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/frozen-shallows-harbor-door-county-wi-320.webp           320w,           /assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/frozen-shallows-harbor-door-county-wi-480.webp   480w,   /assets/img/2025-04-10-door-county-wi-holds-unexpected-charms-for-nature-lovers/frozen-shallows-harbor-door-county-wi-665.webp   665w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="Frozen shallows in the   harbor at Door County, WI" width="665" height="499" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>At 1,600 acres, The Ridges Sanctuary outdoes the others in sheer scale — it’s
nearly twice the size of Whitefish Dunes, four times that of Björklunden. Miles
of trails wind among hearty conifers that form a boreal forest rare for this
latitude. White spruce and balsam fir flourish, even irises and orchids in
warmer months.</p>

<p>If you only have time for one outdoor excursion, take an early morning trip to
Cave Point County Park for a sunrise photo session. Waves from Lake Michigan
batter the shore where icicles cling to dolomite cliffs carved with sea caves,
hidden depths for kayakers and divers to explore. Some of the water escapes
through blowholes, erupting in the air like a geyser.</p>

<p>The winter beauty is only part of the appeal. Door County shines with festive
events that warm the season. At the Door County Maritime Museum in Sturgeon Bay,
the <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/">Merry-Time Festival of Trees</a> runs from November
through mid-December, filling the space with dozens of elaborately decorated
Christmas trees. Alongside exhibits on shipwrecks, lighthouses, and Great Lakes
nautical history, a 101-year-old red tugboat out front glows with white lights.</p>

<p>In Ephraim, <a href="https://ephraim-doorcounty.com/">Christmas in the Village</a> offers a
daylong celebration with caroling, carriage rides, a tree lighting, and a visit
from Saint Nick. The village’s Norwegian heritage shines through old-fashioned
games and Moravian holiday displays.</p>

<p>For holiday shopping, the <a href="https://www.tannenbaumholidayshop.com/">Tannenbaum Holiday
Shop</a> in a 19th-century church sells
everything from nutcrackers and Nativity scenes to snow globes and themed
trees—think music, marine life, or even upside-down firs that save space and
highlight ornaments. It’s a treasure trove of design inspiration.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for authentic Swedish fare, you’ve come to the right place. In
winter, <a href="aljohnsons.com">Al Johnson’s Swedish Restaurant &amp; Butik</a> offers a
genuine Scandinavian banquet — with drinking songs. Their annual Swedish Julbord
in December was a feast of herring, lox, potato sausage, cheeses, and
“julskinka,” the Swedish Christmas ham, all washed down with glögg, a spiced
blend of wine, fruit, and almonds fortified with Swedish vodka. The goats on the
roof may be replaced with lighted reindeer in winter, but the food steals the
show.</p>

<p>In nearby Fish Creek, the Progressive Holiday Dinners on select weekends in
December and January pair a stay at the historic <a href="https://thorphouseinn.com/">Thorp House
Inn</a> and <a href="https://www.whitegullinn.com/">White Gull
Inn</a> with a five-course feast. The evening starts
with hors d’oeuvres and live music, followed by a horse-drawn wagon ride to the
White Gull, elegantly trimmed for the season with guided tours before dinner.</p>
